Handlebars.php
==============

credit
------
This library was taken from `xamin/handlebars.php` because the `xamin/handlebars.php` is out of live.


installation
------------

add the following to require property of your composer.json file:

```
composer require webvconsol/handlebars.php "dev-maste"
composer require webconsol/php-hbs-helpersp "dev-maste"
```

OR, depending on your composer setup

```
php composer.phar require webvconsol/handlebars.php "dev-maste"
